## Introduction

Welcome to the VHDL Processor Project repository! This project is part of our Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering at the University of Twente. Here, we have developed a VHDL-based processor as a part of our coursework. This README provides essential information to help you get started with our project.

## Project Description

The VHDL Processor Project aims to design and implement a processor using VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language). The processor is designed to perform specific tasks, and it serves as a practical application of digital design concepts learned during our coursework. This project encompasses the following key components:

- **VHDL Code:** The VHDL source code that describes the processor's architecture and behavior.

- **Documentation:** Detailed documentation, including design specifications, implementation details, and test plans.

- **Test Benches:** VHDL test benches to verify the functionality of the processor.

- **Simulation Results:** Simulation results and waveforms showcasing the processor's operation.

## Getting Started

To get started with the VHDL Processor Project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepo.git
   ```

2. Ensure you have the necessary tools for working with VHDL, such as Xilinx Vivado or ModelSim.

3. Review the project documentation in the `docs/` directory to understand the processor's design and specifications.

4. Explore the VHDL source code in the `src/` directory to understand the processor's architecture and behavior.

## Usage

To use and simulate the processor, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your VHDL development environment (e.g., Xilinx Vivado or ModelSim).

2. Load the processor's VHDL files and test benches.

3. Simulate the design to verify its functionality.

4. Review the simulation results in the `simulations/` directory to understand how the processor performs.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions and improvements from the community. If you'd like to contribute to the project, please follow these guidelines:

1. Fork the repository.

2. Create a feature branch.

3. Make your changes and improvements.

4. Test your changes thoroughly.
